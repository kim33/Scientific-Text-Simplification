Passage ID 511: Passage 1 reads like a collection of sentences, Passage 2 like a text
Passage ID 542: Passage 1 is less formal
Passage ID 548: more approachable
Passage ID 546: more conversational
Passage ID 552: Sentences are longer but make sense more.
Passage ID 42: Passage 2 sounds more natural.
Its sentences follow standard academic‐English patterns (“reduces the derivation space over which model estimation is performed”), keep subjects and verbs close together, and avoid informal or awkward phrases such as “label assigning process,” “grammar created by a machine,” or “you can achieve much faster speeds,” which make Passage 1 feel less polished. Despite the heavier jargon, Passage 2’s syntax, word choice, and punctuation read smoothly and contain no grammatical slips, giving it a more fluent, professional tone.
Passage ID 43: Passage 1 sounds a little more natural overall.
Its word choices (“arbitrary threshold,” “notion of correctness,” “sentence-level QE system”) match standard academic English and read smoothly, whereas some substitutions in Passage 2—such as “idea of correctness is not easy to understand” and “chosen limit”—feel slightly informal or awkward. Both passages are grammatically correct, but Passage 1’s vocabulary and phrasing align better with conventional, fluent scholarly style.
Passage ID 44: Passage 2 reads more naturally in standard academic English.
Its sentences follow familiar scholarly patterns (“We investigate unsupervised techniques for acquiring monolingual sentence-level paraphrases …”), avoid contractions such as “don’t,” maintain consistent terminology, and keep subjects and verbs close together, giving the prose a smooth, formal flow. Passage 1, by contrast, mixes conversational wording (“look into methods that don’t need human guidance,” “rule of thumb”) with some awkward constructions (“a scoring method from translating languages”), which makes it feel less polished even though both passages are largely grammatical.
Passage ID 45: Passage 1 reads more naturally in polished academic English.
Its sentences employ standard technical terms (“unsupervised language-model adaptation,” “interpolated with a general background model”) and vary rhythm without awkward repetition. Passage 2, while perfectly grammatical, relies on informal or slightly clumsy substitutes (“search requests,” “big improvements,” “adjust language models … without human guidance”) and repeats the same ideas almost verbatim in successive sentences, which makes the prose feel less smooth and professional.
Passage ID 46: Passage 2 sounds more natural and polished.
Its sentences follow standard academic phrasing (“are usually conducted on corpus level,” “we introduce a new evaluation method”), it uses precise connectors (“however,” “such comparisons rely on”), and it avoids conversational fillers like “looking at things like” found in Passage 1. The terminology is consistent and domain-appropriate, and punctuation is handled cleanly, giving the prose a smoother, more professional flow with no noticeable grammatical slips.
Passage ID 47: Passage 1 reads more naturally in polished academic English.
Its terminology (“clump-based statistical MT systems,” “broad-coverage rule-based parsers”) and sentence rhythm match the conventions of research writing, it avoids contractions, and it stays concise without parenthetical asides that break flow. Passage 2, though grammatical, introduces informal touches (“don’t,” “tools that analyze sentence structure”), repeats ideas almost verbatim, and uses slightly awkward substitutions (“group-based,” “while running”), so the prose feels less smooth and professional.
Passage ID 48: Passage 2 sounds more natural and polished.
Its sentences follow standard academic style (“we present,” “evaluate it in both the unsupervised and supervised case”), employ precise vocabulary (“lexicon,” “state-of-the-art,” “framework”), and avoid informal wording or minor slips such as “with help (supervised)” found in Passage 1. Passage 2 also keeps grammatical structures consistent and uses smoother connectors (“Finally,” “Observing that”), giving the prose a fluent, professional flow without awkward pauses or redundancies.
Passage ID 50: Passage 2 reads more naturally in polished academic English.
Its sentences follow standard scholarly phrasing (“complex questions posed in Natural Language,” “performing structured probabilistic inference”), use precise connectors (“In this paper we describe…,” “The results indicate…”), and avoid colloquial expressions like “make informed guesses” that appear in Passage 1. Terminology is used consistently, clauses are balanced, and punctuation is smooth, giving Passage 2 a fluent, professional cadence with no noticeable grammatical slips.
